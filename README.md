### Hey guys 👋
I'm Michal Moravik and I study software development in Copenhagen, Denmark. 
Until half of 2020, I was searching for my deep interest, and so, my repositories are from several different spheres. 
Later I became fascinated with machine learning so expect some cool AI projects in the future!

- 🔎 I'm searching for internship opportunities
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI from its roots
