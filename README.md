### Hey guys 👋
I'm Michal Moravík and I study software development in Copenhagen, Denmark. 
Two years ago, I started searching for my deep interest, thus my repositories are from several different spheres. 
Later I became fascinated with machine learning so expect some cool AI projects in the future!

- 🔎 I'm searching for internship opportunities
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI from its roots
